                    "review": "I was on statins briefly but I had some really bad side effects. My cholesterol is not critical, but it keeps going up every year and has gotten into the bad range. I need to go see my doctor in the next couple months, so I am attempting to do some improvements to my higher levels by taking this along with some dietary and lifestyle changes. \n I have been taking high doses of COQ10 and was looking to replenish my supply when I saw this product. It has very good high quality COQ10, but also other ingredients that might help my cholesterol including Bergamot, Turmeric, and Cardoon (which is artichoke thistle). \n I take these in the morning - 2 capsules. I like that they are capsules and not hard tablets. They do not give me a tummy ache at all. They recommend taking one in the morning and one at night, but I don’t like taking a lot of supplements in the evening. I pretty much keep my night time intake of supplements to my blood pressure medication and natural herbal sleep aids. This is working well as far as I can tell. \n Along with starting to take this product I am also eating oatmeal every other morning. I also walk at least 30 minutes a day and sometimes 2 hours. I also have a home spinning bike so I do 30-45 minutes on that. I am also trying to lose a bit of weight by tracking my calories using Tap and Track app. My point is, just taking this alone isn’t going to solve high cholesterol levels. Combining this with other lifestyle changes will...at least hopefully in my case. I am working really hard to make those changes. \n My only critique of this product is the bergamot, turmeric, and cardoon are not organic. There is a risk if pesticides were used during the growth in process that those pesticides could be concentrated in the extract. I am marking down by 1-star because of that. \n You also get a little freebie gift with this product and I love it! Is a little hot/cold pack. I love heating it up in the microwave, then putting it between my shoulder blades on my back while I lay on my back. It is so relaxing and helps with stress and tension so much. I never thought something so small could make such a difference. It was a nice surprise to get that with this product.",

                    "review": "I was looking for a bergamot supplement and learned that it can be very pricey depending on quality, etc. \n I considered this formula bc it provided reasonably priced bergamot plus coQ10 which I was already taking. \n I have high cholesterol due to genetics so I figured I would give this a try bc I never want to go on statins. Thankfully I'm the MD says I'm too young to start worrying about even needing statins but in my book, prevention is better than correction. Plus, I like to try/rotate diff antioxidants. Bergamot is high in flavonoids which are supposedto help w/ immune sys & inflammation.\n According to the prior reading I'd done, there isnt enough evidence to conclude that it definitely makes a diff in inflammation but there is a number of studies w/ evidence to prove that it's been effective for the treatment of high cholesterol. \n I don't know if its helped any without getting a blood test and I wont be doing that for another 6 months at least. \n So what I can say is that the manufacturer has really done their best to check all the boxes to provide a robust profile of complimentary supplements. The amber glass bottle is beneficial as well bc both bergamot and coQ10 should not be stored in direct light. The literature enclosed was very detailed and the bottle was securely packaged in a padded box (shown in pix). \n Expiration date on my bottle is June 2022.\n I think its worth giving this brand and this specific formula a try. It does cost less than bergamot only supplements so if you ever wanted to try bergamot but were put off by the price, this would be a great way to ease into it & see how you feel. \n I hope my humble opinion helps you in some way. \n Thank you for reading.",

My only caveat is $2-per-day cost of using this supplement as directed. Nevertheless, Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) has important health benefits, much more so than most supplements. This product uses a variation called CholestQ10, and I'm not clear on how it compares with standard CoQ10. It's also a little confusing as to how much the maker recommends daily. The bottle contains 60 capsules and states \"30 servings,\" but the site recommends 3 capsules per day, which means 20-day supply. \n In any case, the generally recommended maximum daily dose of CoQ10 is 1,200 mg/day, and that's for someone with fairly high bad cholesterol levels, though it might be different for CholestQ10. Consequently, since my cholesterol level is only slightly on the high side, I'm taking one capsule per day in addition to red rice yeast capsules. However, too much CoQ10 is not necessarily dangerous; the most common side effects are minor GI distress. In addition to CholestQ10, the other ingredients seem to provide support for digestion and metabolic processes (but this is based solely on my non-expert research). Tea drinkers will recognize another ingredient (bergamot) as the herbal flavor in Earl Gray.\n In general, the company seems to be a good one that strives to provide quality supplements. However, the price is a little above my monthly budget. Nonetheless, if it proves effective, I'd rather pay for this than for prescription pharmaceuticals. For those with high cholesterol and a more generous budget, I'd recommend giving this a try for at least a few months.",

This could have 100 mg or 1 mg of hyaluronic acid, astaxanthin, etc. They don't tell you so it's probably less than you need for actual benefits but that's me being pessimistic. Based on the grams of protein per packet, each tube likely contains around 5 grams of collagen (collagen makes up a tad more than the listed protein grams which are at 4 grams), leaving 0.2 grams, or 200 mg, of hyaluronic acid, orange extracts, and astaxanthin, which isn't too bad.\n  The color is bright from the astaxanthin which is a highly pigmented extract. The flavor is a generic mild fruit flavor, not specifically dragonfruit. I can taste the astaxanthin which has a very specific flavor most people probably won't notice but I can tell it's there because I've tasted astaxanthin before. It has a very subtle fishiness. The sweetness is just right, not too sweet or too sour, and you can add more water or less water to adjust it to your preference. There is an aftertaste but it isn't too bad. It comes from a combination of the stevia and astaxanthin. \n This does contain maltodextrin, likely from corn, which some people prefer to avoid. \n The box I received included an eye mask filled with gel balls, designed to be either frozen or microwaved and laid over your eyes. It was a nice addition although if you're paying full price for this product, you should be given about 18 eye masks to make up for how much they're charging you for 20 small drink servings!",

He took to wearing gloves with softeners inside, and constantly applying creams and treatments to his legs and arms. While like me he did not have male pattern baldness genes, by my age his hair had thinned out much more than mine to where he started to need a comb over. This makes a refreshing drink that tastes good, but not crave worthy. The cost is a bit high, so there may be some supplements that are more cost effective, but the juries out on that just yet. It had no side effects with food or without, and after the full course, I did notice my skin seemed better, and my hair not as dry. The small scabs the seemed to appear when scratching my skull went away. I think this worked better than the prescription shampoo I was using to help that, although I did use in concert, so maybe both helped some.\n            Nicely packaged and easy to take, it contains collagen from cows (bovine) which is extracted from the bones. I know this because. When I can get beef bones from bone in roasts or steak, I stew just below the boiling point for almost 20 hours to create a bone broth for my ramen. Frankly if this wasn't fruit flavored I'd considered using it for that purpose. Recommended.",

But, I would still give this a high rating, if you can afford it, because I loved what the booklet says about the source of the collagen: \"an organic. non-GMO, halal, and kosher certified bovine source raised exclusively on a plant based diet supplied by small European farming partners.\" \n  I have been using collagen powders for years but I'm very aware that there are a lot of different qualities and sources. I love that this one comes from an organic, grass-fed source. I just wish that they could find a way to flavor it better because I have tried really delicious collagen-based drinks and found this one barely edible by comparison. I'd give it one star for flavor.The other reason I rated this highly is that I like the addition of the hyaluronic acid. I've used astaxanthin before as both an anti-oxidant and for its awesome sunscreen powers but I've only used hyaluronic acid for skin care, never orally so I was curious to see the results. I felt like I did see an improvement in my facial wrinkles while I was taking two of these a day. I'm not sure I'll purchase again because I really did not enjoy them, but if you can afford them and don't mind the taste, they are definitely worth a try.",

My nails have a tendency to split, which is very annoying  but after drinking this several days, I can definitely tell my nails are growing stronger.  \n The sticks are so convenient in that they are premeasured and individually packaged.  They are great for on-the-go or in a rush.  I don’t have to use a funnel to add the powder to my water bottle, and with several shakes of the bottle, it is ready to drink. \n I was very surprised to also receive a round lip balm in the box with my collagen sticks.  It’s a shiny copper plastic container that is easy to locate, it’s easy to apply, and my lips feel immediately soft and smooth.   I’m sure you won’t be disappointed with the collagen, nor bonus lip balm!",

                    "review": "I've tried a lot of collagen drink supplements and would say this is a good quality one in terms of ingredients, amount of actual collagen, and variety of added skin-nourishing elements like hyaluronic acid, etc.\n The label doesn't specify the exact milligrams of each of the active ingredients and I removed a star for that because when it comes to supplements, companies usually charge you a lot for fancy packaging and a product that doesn't offer your money's weight in quantity and potency of active ingredients. This could have 100 mg or 1 mg of hyaluronic acid, astaxanthin, etc. They don't tell you so it's probably less than you need for actual benefits but that's me being pessimistic. Based on the grams of protein per packet, each tube likely contains around 5 grams of collagen (collagen makes up a tad more than the listed protein grams which are at 4 grams), leaving 0.2 grams, or 200 mg, of hyaluronic acid, orange extracts, and astaxanthin, which isn't too bad. \n The color is bright from the astaxanthin which is a highly pigmented extract. The flavor is a generic mild fruit flavor, not specifically dragonfruit. I can taste the astaxanthin which has a very specific flavor most people probably won't notice but I can tell it's there because I've tasted astaxanthin before. It has a very subtle fishiness. The sweetness is just right, not too sweet or too sour, and you can add more water or less water to adjust it to your preference. There is an aftertaste but it isn't too bad. It comes from a combination of the stevia and astaxanthin. \n This does contain maltodextrin, likely from corn, which some people prefer to avoid. \n   The box I received included an eye mask filled with gel balls, designed to be either frozen or microwaved and laid over your eyes. It was a nice addition although if you're paying full price for this product, you should be given about 18 eye masks to make up for how much they're charging you for 20 small drink servings!",

While like me he did not have male pattern baldness genes, by my age his hair had thinned out much more than mine to where he started to need a comb over. This makes a refreshing drink that tastes good, but not crave worthy. The cost is a bit high, so there may be some supplements that are more cost effective, but the juries out on that just yet. It had no side effects with food or without, and after the full course, I did notice my skin seemed better, and my hair not as dry. The small scabs the seemed to appear when scratching my skull went away. I think this worked better than the prescription shampoo I was using to help that, although I did use in concert, so maybe both helped some. \n  Nicely packaged and easy to take, it contains collagen from cows (bovine) which is extracted from the bones. I know this because. When I can get beef bones from bone in roasts or steak, I stew just below the boiling point for almost 20 hours to create a bone broth for my ramen. Frankly if this wasn't fruit flavored I'd considered using it for that purpose. Recommended.",

But, I would still give this a high rating, if you can afford it, because I loved what the booklet says about the source of the collagen: \"an organic. non-GMO, halal, and kosher certified bovine source raised exclusively on a plant based diet supplied by small European farming partners.\" \n I have been using collagen powders for years but I'm very aware that there are a lot of different qualities and sources. I love that this one comes from an organic, grass-fed source. I just wish that they could find a way to flavor it better because I have tried really delicious collagen-based drinks and found this one barely edible by comparison. I'd give it one star for flavor. \n The other reason I rated this highly is that I like the addition of the hyaluronic acid. I've used astaxanthin before as both an anti-oxidant and for its awesome sunscreen powers but I've only used hyaluronic acid for skin care, never orally so I was curious to see the results. I felt like I did see an improvement in my facial wrinkles while I was taking two of these a day. I'm not sure I'll purchase again because I really did not enjoy them, but if you can afford them and don't mind the taste, they are definitely worth a try.",

To the point actually looked at my cup to see if I could find any strawberry seeds because I felt like a literally just made strawberry juice. The acai does give it a slightly sour aftertaste but please do not at that turn you off. I would say that I missed taste more like a fresh strawberry with that naturally has a natural sour taste to it and less like a strawberry candy that is only sweet. The only con that I have is that it does not mix very well in cold water. If you make this drink I recommend either put in a shaker cup or a blender. Otherwise this is freaking delicious.",

                    "review": "This supplement has bilberry, the one ingredient here that is not included in my regular eye supplement, Areds2. I've read that bilberry has been used by the Navajo Nation for eye care for centuries, and that it works. That's why I decided to try this formula when it was offered through Amazon Vine. \n Having said that, this supplement includes only a one month supply, and costs twice as much as the two-month supply I normally buy from a name brand pharmaceutical company whose product is tested and clinically proven for its stated purpose (which this one is not).\n The other thing that bothers me about this product, besides the price (which throws in an eye massage mask and a glitzy marketing brochure in an expensive gift box), is that the item lists its ingredients as being 229 mg overall, but its label does NOT list the exact amounts of each active ingredient. So one is denied the knowledge of how much of each active ingredient one is taking, whether it is too much vitamin E (or not enough), too much lutein (or not enough), and so on. \n Unfortunately, that makes this item a no go for my future use. There are levels of certain ingredients that are required for eye care. And there are levels of certain ingredients that can be toxic.\n This \"proprietary blend\" does not list what you need to know. \n Thus the company feels free to jack up the price, and it can prevent others from trying to \"knock off\"  its \"special\" formula. Maybe it also hoodwinks some into taking too much or too little of something they need. \n I'll use the formula until it's gone, but I would not buy this again for the stated reasons. My eyes are too previous to play with the unknown. \n Meanwhile I will try to find another standalone source of bilberry to add to my eye regimen and will also try to discover the optimal dosage for bilberry in eye care.",

I opened the capsule and you can see it in the video. The content surprised me with its appearance, color and smell:\n- inside a jelly-like mass in color resembling blood from a vein or clotted blood. Let's think it's blueberry jam. The contents were very viscous, sticky and would stick strongly to any surface. It wasn't tasty. It was not washed off either from the fingers or from the plate or from the knife just by a stream of water. In order to wash it off, I had to take a dish sponge. I washed it off the dishes, but my finger and nail were stained with this content and it didn't wash off immediately. In the photo you can see how my fingers look after I washed them with a dishwashing sponge;\n- the contents of the capsule smell to me like the smell of fish oil. It was like the smell of the opened Fish oil capsule, but not so strong. My wife said that she can smell fish;\n I hope that what I saw and showed you is useful for us and is a combination of useful products.\n Buying any supplements, vitamins and so on, the most important thing is not to harm yourself and not buy any charlatan's product. Therefore, I always try to find out who makes the product. I liked what I learned about this company and the fact that the company has been in business for over 25 years.\n I am an Uber driver and I spend a lot of time behind the wheel, including in the dark. And of course I am no exception, and like most people I like to sit in front of a computer with a phone or tablet. Of course, all this puts a huge strain on the eyes. Therefore, I believe that it is very important to help your eyes, and for this you can do eye exercises and take the appropriate vitamins. Therefore, in my diet there are always blueberries as well as vitamin supplements.\n What I got with this product and what conclusion can I draw:\n - judging by the way the company cares about its image and presents its product, and as I said above, given the company's experience, I tend to trust their product;\n - I liked the bonus in the form of an eye mask. It's not an expensive feature, but nevertheless it's nice to get and useful to use.\n I have to be honest with you: after completing the course and drinking all the vitamins, I did not begin to see further better, and so on. You perfectly understand that miracles do not happen. But I am sure that I supported my eyes and gave them what we lack in our intense rhythm of life. I am sure that I should take care of my eyes and the whole body now so that later in a more mature age I would have fewer problems. \n wish you all take care of your eyes and stay healthy! \n Thanks for reading this review. If my comments were helpful, let me know. You can ask a question and someone from the community will definitely answer you and maybe it will be me.",

So it impossible to know if the ingredients one is seeking is here in a goodly amount. Judging by the vit E content I would expect this to be a good product in that the E is in natural form and a decent dosage.. ((( NATURAL VIT E = is labeled various ways = d-alpha tocopheral = d-alpha tocopheryl acetate = d-alpha tocopheryl succinate. >>> alpha tocopheryl is the most active biological form SYNTHETIC VIT E = forms are labeled with a dl prefix Both natural and synthetic tocopherols are subject to oxidation, and so in dietary supplements are esterified creating tocophphe tocopheryl acetate for stability purposes))) It's well documented that bilberry - Lutein & Zeaxanthin strongly support good eye health. And work better together than they do singularly. Bruno says their blend is protection and relief from CVS (Computer Vision Syndrome). which is a main reason I wanted to try this product. This is the fanciest / high end presentation of a vitamin I've ever seen. Comes in a strong cardboard box with 32 page booklet of thier products. And a complimentary (reusable eye mask that can be heated in the microwave or cooled in the freezer for hot / cold compresses for your eyes.
