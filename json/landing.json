          "expanded": "Curcumin is a member of the diarylheptanoid class of natural products (curcuminoids) derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L., an East Indian plant, commonly called turmeric. Curcumin is the most studied compound in the world. Bruno MD’s curcumin phytosome is independently endorsed by the prestigious Cleveland Clinic as the #1 doctor recommended curcumin formulation in the turmeric market and the formulation of choice for their leading practitioners and their patients.  Turmeric and has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia, China, and India for cooking and medicinal uses. Curcumin Phytosome is clinically proven in 35 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, published clinical trials to promote a healthy inflammatory response, boost immune response, and provide relief from exercise-related pain.   It works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the full bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin). It is called a “Life Guardian” because it helps control chronic inflammation and boost immune response at any age.  Western scientists have rigorously tested Turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease. Results show that Turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system: (vii.193)  Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. (vii.68) Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. (vii.194) Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. (vii.193, 195) Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193) Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. (vii.196) Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease (by blocking free radical damage and boosting mitochondrial function). (vii.197) Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause stroke. (vii.198-199) Prevent cardiac hypertrophy due to high blood pressure, heart attack, high salt intake, or diabetes. An enlarged heart can lead to heart failure and even death. (vii.193) Protects the heart from injury caused by sepsis and chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193, 200)  Turmeric’s rhizome contains potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies suggest that some of the ways turmeric compounds protect liver cells and can help prevent liver fibrosis are as follows: (vii.13)  Stimulating transcription factor proteins that prompt genes to generate natural antioxidants (such as glutathione). (vii.13) Preventing activation and growth of cells in the liver that produce excess structural components. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts are the cells mainly involved in fibrosis. (vii.13) Suppressing inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-κB) and cytokine proteins (such as TNF-α) that can activate HSCs directly and/or indirectly. For example, TNF-α directly blocks signals from insulin, the hormone needed to metabolize blood sugar. Impaired sugar metabolism can activate HSCs. (vii.13, 31, 279) Promoting other transcription factor proteins, such as PPAR-γ, that block the activation and proliferation of HSCs. PPAR-γ also suppresses the expression of inflammatory proteins, such as the growth factor TGF-β, that promote collagen production. (vii.13, 198) Decreasing harmful triglyceride and cholesterol deposits in the liver. (vii.279) Reducing type I collagen, the primary substance in fibrotic scar tissue in the liver produced by HSCs and fibroblasts. (vii.284)"

Echinacea Angustifolia Phytosome is optimized for maximum absorption. Results in clinical trials conducted using our triple-standardized Echinacea Phytosome have shown a statistically significant tendency to be more efficacious than flu vaccination alone, suggesting that E.

Additionally, quercetin is a polyphenol which is rejected by our bodies.   Bruno MD uses Phytosome technology to bring the benefits of quercetin to every cell in your body. Research has substantiated that Quercetin Phytosome is 2000% more bioavailable than standard quercetin.   Clinical studies confirm that quercetin has strong antiviral and antiinflammatory effects. A natural immunomodulator, quercetin helps block harmful viruses and bacteria and even demonstrates anti-cancer properties.   The ultra bioavailability provided by the Phytosome delivery system also improves athletic performance and accelerates fitness recovery with quercetin’s proven anti-inflammatory properties. [43,44]  Quercetin’s anti-inflammatory potential can be expressed on different cell types, both in animal and human models [45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53].    It possesses both mast cell stabilizing and gastrointestinal cytoprotective activity [54] and can also play a modulating, biphasic, and regulatory action on inflammation and immunity [53].   Additionally, quercetin has an immunosuppressive effect on dendritic cell function [55]."

Italians have prized this way of eating as a cornerstone of their “Dolce Vita” lifestyle for centuries, and the proof is in the panna cotta. Experts believe this healthy, active way of living could be why one of the five Blue Zones worldwide, areas where people regularly live to be over 100 years old, can be found in the Mediterranean. Blue zones like the one in Sardinia, Italy offer secrets to longevity unavailable anywhere else, and their secrets are more important now than ever as worldwide cases of heart-related diseases in women and men are at an all-time high. Bruno MD, a part of one of Italy's largest pharmaceutical companies, has worked tirelessly to harness some of the heart-supporting ingredients of these Blue Zones and the Mediterranean diet and bring them to you, no passport required. The result is the revolutionary supplement CholestQ10®",

          "expanded": "Our bodies have evolved to view beneficial plant-based polyphenols as useless or dangerous. For this reason, nutrients that help manage inflammation, like curcumin, are blocked by your gut before they can enter your bloodstream. So no matter how much curcumin you take, the benefits are minimal without the new Phytosome Technology used by Bruno MD. Phytosome uses biomimicry to wrap polyphenols in a fatty lipid, like a delivery truck. Then, with the curcumin molecule hidden inside, the lipid passes through the gut and into your bloodstream with 3000% more bioavailability. As a result, Phytosome sets the new standard in prescription-grade natural ingredients. CHOLESTQ10 PROPRIETARY PHYTOSOME® COMPLEX is a powerful combination of clinically proven ingredients validated in more than 40 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. It is also shown to have long-term high tolerability (the degree to which a person can tolerate noticeable adverse effects of an ingredient) in an 18-month clinical study with no side effects.",

If you've tried Earl Grey tea, you're familiar with the taste of bergamot. Bergamot Phytosome® is clinically proven to protect against cardiovascular issues by supporting healthy cholesterol levels. It also helps govern metabolic conditions that increase the risk of heart disease and TYPE II diabetes. It's the green “gold standard” of heart health. In addition, Bergamot Phytosome optimizes the biological absorption of polyphenols, typically characterized by poor solubility in both water and organic solvents. The beneficial flavonoids in Bergamot help maintain healthy blood lipid levels. A recent NHI study showed that daily supplementation with bergamot over thirty helped lower LDL cholesterol and stimulated healthy HDL cholesterol levels. In addition to helping support healthy blood lipid levels, the flavonoids in bergamot also support vascular endothelium health, which is important for vasoconstriction, arterial responsiveness, and overall circulatory health. In addition, Bergamot Phytosome extract helps promote healthy blood glucose levels, which, when combined with a balanced weight management plan and regular exercise, supports general cardiovascular health.",

Curcumin Phytosome works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the whole bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin). Western scientists have rigorously tested turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease. Results show that turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system: Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease. Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause a stroke.

Curcumin is the most studied compound in the world. Bruno MD’s curcumin phytosome is independently endorsed by the prestigious Cleveland Clinic as the #1 doctor recommended curcumin formulation in the turmeric market and the formulation of choice for their leading practitioners and their patients.  Turmeric and has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia, China, and India for cooking and medicinal uses. Curcumin Phytosome is clinically proven in 35 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, published clinical trials to promote a healthy inflammatory response, boost immune response, and provide relief from exercise-related pain.   It works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the full bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin). It is called a “Life Guardian” because it helps control chronic inflammation and boost immune response at any age.  Western scientists have rigorously tested Turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease. Results show that Turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system: (vii.193)  Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. (vii.68) Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. (vii.194) Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. (vii.193, 195) Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193) Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. (vii.196) Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease (by blocking free radical damage and boosting mitochondrial function). (vii.197) Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause stroke. (vii.198-199) Prevent cardiac hypertrophy due to high blood pressure, heart attack, high salt intake, or diabetes. An enlarged heart can lead to heart failure and even death. (vii.193) Protects the heart from injury caused by sepsis and chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193, 200)  Turmeric’s rhizome contains potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies suggest that some of the ways turmeric compounds protect liver cells and can help prevent liver fibrosis are as follows: (vii.13)  Stimulating transcription factor proteins that prompt genes to generate natural antioxidants (such as glutathione). (vii.13) Preventing activation and growth of cells in the liver that produce excess structural components. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts are the cells mainly involved in fibrosis. (vii.13) Suppressing inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-κB) and cytokine proteins (such as TNF-α) that can activate HSCs directly and/or indirectly. For example, TNF-α directly blocks signals from insulin, the hormone needed to metabolize blood sugar. Impaired sugar metabolism can activate HSCs. (vii.13, 31, 279) Promoting other transcription factor proteins, such as PPAR-γ, that block the activation and proliferation of HSCs. PPAR-γ also suppresses the expression of inflammatory proteins, such as the growth factor TGF-β, that promote collagen production. (vii.13, 198) Decreasing harmful triglyceride and cholesterol deposits in the liver. (vii.279) Reducing type I collagen, the primary substance in fibrotic scar tissue in the liver produced by HSCs and fibroblasts. (vii.284)"

In addition, clinical studies have shown that a cocktail of AKBA (Acetyl-11-Keto-𝛃-Boswellic Acid) and curcumin significantly inhibit certain viral infections (viral entry) compared to the untreated control. BRUNO MD uses Boswellia Phytosome extract that is 400% more bioavailable than regular Boswellia."

Historically other uses include relief of mouth pain and toothache, treatment of the common cold and cough, tonsillitis relief, and treatment of septic diseases.   Bruno MD cultivates our coneflower from an Italian varietal. Our plants guarantee high polysaccharides and low cross-contamination between Echinacea species.   Echinacea Angustifolia Phytosome is optimized for maximum absorption. Results in clinical trials conducted using our triple-standardized Echinacea Phytosome have shown a statistically significant tendency to be more efficacious than flu vaccination alone, suggesting that E. Phytosome has the potential to act synergistically with influenza vaccination."

Nucleotides also enhance the anti-inflammatory activity of Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Zinc. They are gluten-free, vegan, kosher, and halal. BRUNO MD combines Nucleoflam with Astaxanthin, the most potent anti-inflammatory known in Nature. Together they create a powerful shield against chronic inflammation."

In addition, natural astaxanthin has clinically demonstrated the ability to balance and strengthen the immune system while enhancing antibody production. This increase in antibodies improves our bodies’ defense against inflammation and the pathogens that can make us sick.  Astaxanthin can also help reduce high blood pressure, improve heart health, prevent type II diabetes, and decrease the risk of brain damage from a stroke.  Over 95% of commercial astaxanthin is synthetic. Worse, it is harvested using petrochemicals. Bruno MD Astaxanthin is naturally derived from Haematococcus Pluvialis algae, found in temperate environments around the world to produce the highest concentrations of astaxanthin with the highest bioavailability."

Quercetin is not an easy nutrient to get into your diet. To obtain just one daily dose of quercetin you’d need to eat about 100 kilos of broccoli.  Additionally, quercetin is a polyphenol which is rejected by our bodies.Bruno MD uses Phytosome technology to bring the benefits of quercetin to every cell in your body. Research has substantiated that Quercetin Phytosome is 2000% more bioavailable than standard quercetin.   Clinical studies confirm that quercetin has strong antiviral and antiinflammatory effects. A natural immunomodulator, quercetin helps block harmful viruses and bacteria and even demonstrates anti-cancer properties.   The ultra bioavailability provided by the Phytosome delivery system also improves athletic performance and accelerates fitness recovery with quercetin’s proven anti-inflammatory properties. [43,44]  Quercetin’s anti-inflammatory potential can be expressed on different cell types, both in animal and human models [45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53].It possesses both mast cell stabilizing and gastrointestinal cytoprotective activity [54] and can also play a modulating, biphasic, and regulatory action on inflammation and immunity [53].Additionally, quercetin has an immunosuppressive effect on dendritic cell function [55]."

Curcumin is the most studied compound in the world. Bruno MD’s curcumin phytosome is independently endorsed by the prestigious Cleveland Clinic as the #1 doctor recommended curcumin formulation in the turmeric market and the formulation of choice for their leading practitioners and their patients.  Turmeric and has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia, China, and India for cooking and medicinal uses. Curcumin Phytosome is clinically proven in 35 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, published clinical trials to promote a healthy inflammatory response, boost immune response, and provide relief from exercise-related pain.   It works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the full bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin). It is called a “Life Guardian” because it helps control chronic inflammation and boost immune response at any age.  Western scientists have rigorously tested Turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease. Results show that Turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system: (vii.193)  Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. (vii.68) Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. (vii.194) Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. (vii.193, 195) Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193) Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. (vii.196) Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease (by blocking free radical damage and boosting mitochondrial function). (vii.197) Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause stroke. (vii.198-199) Prevent cardiac hypertrophy due to high blood pressure, heart attack, high salt intake, or diabetes. An enlarged heart can lead to heart failure and even death. (vii.193) Protects the heart from injury caused by sepsis and chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193, 200)  Turmeric’s rhizome contains potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies suggest that some of the ways turmeric compounds protect liver cells and can help prevent liver fibrosis are as follows: (vii.13)  Stimulating transcription factor proteins that prompt genes to generate natural antioxidants (such as glutathione). (vii.13) Preventing activation and growth of cells in the liver that produce excess structural components. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts are the cells mainly involved in fibrosis. (vii.13) Suppressing inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-κB) and cytokine proteins (such as TNF-α) that can activate HSCs directly and/or indirectly. For example, TNF-α directly blocks signals from insulin, the hormone needed to metabolize blood sugar. Impaired sugar metabolism can activate HSCs. (vii.13, 31, 279) Promoting other transcription factor proteins, such as PPAR-γ, that block the activation and proliferation of HSCs. PPAR-γ also suppresses the expression of inflammatory proteins, such as the growth factor TGF-β, that promote collagen production. (vii.13, 198) Decreasing harmful triglyceride and cholesterol deposits in the liver. (vii.279) Reducing type I collagen, the primary substance in fibrotic scar tissue in the liver produced by HSCs and fibroblasts. (vii.284)"

Boswellia Serrata Phytosome helps govern inflammatory response in the joints, bones, respiratory airways, the bowel, and brain.   In addition, clinical studies have shown that a cocktail of AKBA (Acetyl-11-Keto-𝛃-Boswellic Acid) and curcumin significantly inhibit certain viral infections (viral entry) compared to the untreated control. BRUNO MD uses Boswellia Phytosome extract that is 400% more bioavailable than regular Boswellia."

Bruno MD cultivates our coneflower from an Italian varietal. Our plants guarantee high polysaccharides and low cross-contamination between Echinacea species.   Echinacea Angustifolia Phytosome is optimized for maximum absorption. Results in clinical trials conducted using our triple-standardized Echinacea Phytosome have shown a statistically significant tendency to be more efficacious than flu vaccination alone, suggesting that E.

Astaxanthin can also help reduce high blood pressure, improve heart health, prevent type II diabetes, and decrease the risk of brain damage from a stroke.  Over 95% of commercial astaxanthin is synthetic. Worse, it is harvested using petrochemicals.

Additionally, quercetin is a polyphenol which is rejected by our bodies.Bruno MD uses Phytosome technology to bring the benefits of quercetin to every cell in your body. Research has substantiated that Quercetin Phytosome is 2000% more bioavailable than standard quercetin.   Clinical studies confirm that quercetin has strong antiviral and antiinflammatory effects. A natural immunomodulator, quercetin helps block harmful viruses and bacteria and even demonstrates anti-cancer properties.   The ultra bioavailability provided by the Phytosome delivery system also improves athletic performance and accelerates fitness recovery with quercetin’s proven anti-inflammatory properties. [43,44]  Quercetin’s anti-inflammatory potential can be expressed on different cell types, both in animal and human models [45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53].It possesses both mast cell stabilizing and gastrointestinal cytoprotective activity [54] and can also play a modulating, biphasic, and regulatory action on inflammation and immunity [53].Additionally, quercetin has an immunosuppressive effect on dendritic cell function [55]."

Curcumin Phytosome is clinically proven in 35 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, published clinical trials to promote a healthy inflammatory response, boost immune response, and provide relief from exercise-related pain.   It works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the full bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin). It is called a “Life Guardian” because it helps control chronic inflammation and boost immune response at any age.  Western scientists have rigorously tested Turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease. Results show that Turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system: (vii.193)  Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. (vii.68) Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. (vii.194) Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. (vii.193, 195) Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193) Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. (vii.196) Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease (by blocking free radical damage and boosting mitochondrial function). (vii.197) Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause stroke. (vii.198-199) Prevent cardiac hypertrophy due to high blood pressure, heart attack, high salt intake, or diabetes. An enlarged heart can lead to heart failure and even death. (vii.193) Protects the heart from injury caused by sepsis and chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193, 200)  Turmeric’s rhizome contains potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies suggest that some of the ways turmeric compounds protect liver cells and can help prevent liver fibrosis are as follows: (vii.13)  Stimulating transcription factor proteins that prompt genes to generate natural antioxidants (such as glutathione). (vii.13) Preventing activation and growth of cells in the liver that produce excess structural components. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts are the cells mainly involved in fibrosis. (vii.13) Suppressing inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-κB) and cytokine proteins (such as TNF-α) that can activate HSCs directly and/or indirectly. For example, TNF-α directly blocks signals from insulin, the hormone needed to metabolize blood sugar. Impaired sugar metabolism can activate HSCs. (vii.13, 31, 279) Promoting other transcription factor proteins, such as PPAR-γ, that block the activation and proliferation of HSCs. PPAR-γ also suppresses the expression of inflammatory proteins, such as the growth factor TGF-β, that promote collagen production. (vii.13, 198) Decreasing harmful triglyceride and cholesterol deposits in the liver. (vii.279) Reducing type I collagen, the primary substance in fibrotic scar tissue in the liver produced by HSCs and fibroblasts. (vii.284)"

Boswellia Serrata Phytosome helps govern inflammatory response in the joints, bones, respiratory airways, the bowel, and brain.   In addition, clinical studies have shown that a cocktail of AKBA (Acetyl-11-Keto-𝛃-Boswellic Acid) and curcumin significantly inhibit certain viral infections (viral entry) compared to the untreated control. BRUNO MD uses Boswellia Phytosome extract that is 400% more bioavailable than regular Boswellia."

Historically other uses include relief of mouth pain and toothache, treatment of the common cold and cough, tonsillitis relief, and treatment of septic diseases.   Bruno MD cultivates our coneflower from an Italian varietal. Our plants guarantee high polysaccharides and low cross-contamination between Echinacea species.   Echinacea Angustifolia Phytosome is optimized for maximum absorption. Results in clinical trials conducted using our triple-standardized Echinacea Phytosome have shown a statistically significant tendency to be more efficacious than flu vaccination alone, suggesting that E. Phytosome has the potential to act synergistically with influenza vaccination."

Quercetin is not an easy nutrient to get into your diet. To obtain just one daily dose of quercetin you’d need to eat about 100 kilos of broccoli.  Additionally, quercetin is a polyphenol which is rejected by our bodies.Bruno MD uses Phytosome technology to bring the benefits of quercetin to every cell in your body. Research has substantiated that Quercetin Phytosome is 2000% more bioavailable than standard quercetin.   Clinical studies confirm that quercetin has strong antiviral and antiinflammatory effects. A natural immunomodulator, quercetin helps block harmful viruses and bacteria and even demonstrates anti-cancer properties.   The ultra bioavailability provided by the Phytosome delivery system also improves athletic performance and accelerates fitness recovery with quercetin’s proven anti-inflammatory properties. [43,44]  Quercetin’s anti-inflammatory potential can be expressed on different cell types, both in animal and human models [45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53].It possesses both mast cell stabilizing and gastrointestinal cytoprotective activity [54] and can also play a modulating, biphasic, and regulatory action on inflammation and immunity [53].Additionally, quercetin has an immunosuppressive effect on dendritic cell function [55]."

Science calls this endogenous, but we just call it beauty from the inside out.</p><br><p>Unlike <b>standard</b> collagen peptides, Bruno MD® and its research partners have discovered the technology to precisely cut collagen peptides that specifically target cartilage growth, firmer skin, and stronger bones!</p><br/><p>The science? Glad you asked.</p><br/><p>Bruno MD’s technology is called <b>Specific and controlled enzymatic hydrolysis</b>.</p><br/><p>After extraction, collagen consists of very long amino acid chains. These chains are then cut down (hydrolyzed) with the help of enzymes. Enzymes are like natural scissors that trim long chains of amino acids into <b>smaller fragments</b> that your body can easily use.</p><br/><p>Once cut, these peptides then need to be optimized. Our patented process fine tunes the chain length, molecular weight and precise sequence of amino acids needed to stimulate exact cells in our bodies that are responsible for connective tissue metabolism.</p><br/><p>Next, we supercharge our formula with <b>Red Orange Complex</b>, a potent organic form of vitamin C extracted from a unique variety of blood oranges grown only along the slopes of Mount Etna Volcano in Italy! Our Red Orange Complex maximizes collagen formation and boosts your immunity by providing your body with over 400% of the daily recommended value of Vitamin C. In addition, Red Orange Complex contains precious phenolic compounds which help prevent collagen degradation induced by environmental factors.",

Here’s the truth: collagen can’t repair existing hair, but it can significantly improve new hair. Here’s how:  the blood vessels that supply nutrients to your roots are made of collagen. In other words, improved microcirculation from our specific collagen peptides helps increase hair vitality and strength by growing healthier hair from the roots up! Hair grows faster and more robust with renewed luster and bounce.<br/>",

We already learned that collagen can’t improve existing hair and the same rules apply to existing nail growth (no matter what other collagen companies say). <br/>What Royal Collagen Peptides will do is significantly improve new nail growth.<br/>We do this in two ways: First, Royal Collagen improves microcirculation to the nail bed. Next, this flood of nutrients stimulates (upregulates) the genes responsible for the assembly line of proteins that create strong, healthy nails. That’s foundational beauty!<br/> ",

Curcumin is the most studied compound in the world. Bruno MD’s curcumin phytosome is independently endorsed by the prestigious Cleveland Clinic as the #1 doctor recommended curcumin formulation in the turmeric market and the formulation of choice for their leading practitioners and their patients.  Turmeric and has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia, China, and India for cooking and medicinal uses. Curcumin Phytosome is clinically proven in 35 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, published clinical trials to promote a healthy inflammatory response, boost immune response, and provide relief from exercise-related pain.   It works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the full bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin). It is called a “Life Guardian” because it helps control chronic inflammation and boost immune response at any age.  Western scientists have rigorously tested Turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease. Results show that Turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system: (vii.193)  Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. (vii.68) Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. (vii.194) Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. (vii.193, 195) Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193) Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. (vii.196) Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease (by blocking free radical damage and boosting mitochondrial function). (vii.197) Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause stroke. (vii.198-199) Prevent cardiac hypertrophy due to high blood pressure, heart attack, high salt intake, or diabetes. An enlarged heart can lead to heart failure and even death. (vii.193) Protects the heart from injury caused by sepsis and chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193, 200)  Turmeric’s rhizome contains potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies suggest that some of the ways turmeric compounds protect liver cells and can help prevent liver fibrosis are as follows: (vii.13)  Stimulating transcription factor proteins that prompt genes to generate natural antioxidants (such as glutathione). (vii.13) Preventing activation and growth of cells in the liver that produce excess structural components. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts are the cells mainly involved in fibrosis. (vii.13) Suppressing inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-κB) and cytokine proteins (such as TNF-α) that can activate HSCs directly and/or indirectly. For example, TNF-α directly blocks signals from insulin, the hormone needed to metabolize blood sugar. Impaired sugar metabolism can activate HSCs. (vii.13, 31, 279) Promoting other transcription factor proteins, such as PPAR-γ, that block the activation and proliferation of HSCs. PPAR-γ also suppresses the expression of inflammatory proteins, such as the growth factor TGF-β, that promote collagen production. (vii.13, 198) Decreasing harmful triglyceride and cholesterol deposits in the liver. (vii.279) Reducing type I collagen, the primary substance in fibrotic scar tissue in the liver produced by HSCs and fibroblasts. (vii.284)",

Astaxanthin can also help reduce high blood pressure, improve heart health, prevent type II diabetes, and decrease the risk of brain damage from a stroke."

Clinical studies confirm that quercetin has strong antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. A natural immunomodulator, quercetin helps block harmful viruses and bacteria and even demonstrates anti-cancer properties. The ultra bioavailability provided by the Phytosome delivery system also improves athletic performance and accelerates fitness recovery with quercetin’s proven anti-inflammatory properties. [43,44] Quercetin’s anti-inflammatory potential can be expressed in different cell types, both in animal and human models [45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53]. It possesses both mast cell stabilizing and gastrointestinal cytoprotective activity [54] and can also play a modulating, biphasic, and regulatory action on inflammation and immunity [53]. Additionally, quercetin has an immunosuppressive effect on dendritic cell function [55]."

          "expanded": "Curcumin is a member of the diarylheptanoid class of natural products (curcuminoids) derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L., an East Indian plant, commonly called turmeric. Curcumin is the most studied compound in the world. Bruno MD’s curcumin phytosome is independently endorsed by the prestigious Cleveland Clinic as the #1 doctor recommended curcumin formulation in the turmeric market and the formulation of choice for their leading practitioners and their patients.  Turmeric and has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia, China, and India for cooking and medicinal uses. Curcumin Phytosome is clinically proven in 35 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, published clinical trials to promote a healthy inflammatory response, boost immune response, and provide relief from exercise-related pain.   It works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the full bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin). It is called a “Life Guardian” because it helps control chronic inflammation and boost immune response at any age.  Western scientists have rigorously tested Turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease. Results show that Turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system: (vii.193)  Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. (vii.68) Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. (vii.194) Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. (vii.193, 195) Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193) Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. (vii.196) Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease (by blocking free radical damage and boosting mitochondrial function). (vii.197) Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause stroke. (vii.198-199) Prevent cardiac hypertrophy due to high blood pressure, heart attack, high salt intake, or diabetes. An enlarged heart can lead to heart failure and even death. (vii.193) Protects the heart from injury caused by sepsis and chemotherapy drugs. (vii.193, 200)  Turmeric’s rhizome contains potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies suggest that some of the ways turmeric compounds protect liver cells and can help prevent liver fibrosis are as follows: (vii.13)  Stimulating transcription factor proteins that prompt genes to generate natural antioxidants (such as glutathione). (vii.13) Preventing activation and growth of cells in the liver that produce excess structural components. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts are the cells mainly involved in fibrosis. (vii.13) Suppressing inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-κB) and cytokine proteins (such as TNF-α) that can activate HSCs directly and/or indirectly. For example, TNF-α directly blocks signals from insulin, the hormone needed to metabolize blood sugar. Impaired sugar metabolism can activate HSCs. (vii.13, 31, 279) Promoting other transcription factor proteins, such as PPAR-γ, that block the activation and proliferation of HSCs. PPAR-γ also suppresses the expression of inflammatory proteins, such as the growth factor TGF-β, that promote collagen production. (vii.13, 198) Decreasing harmful triglyceride and cholesterol deposits in the liver. (vii.279) Reducing type I collagen, the primary substance in fibrotic scar tissue in the liver produced by HSCs and fibroblasts. (vii.284)",

It works through multiple pathways on multiple targets to provide complete relief throughout the body. The extract has been standardized and contains the full bouquet of curcuminoids, not just curcumin (Curcuminoids are polyphenolic pigments and include 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin).<br/>It is called a “Life Guardian” because it helps control chronic inflammation and boost immune response at any age. Western scientists have rigorously tested Turmeric and its compounds for decades, including for heart disease.<br/>Results show that Turmeric has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system:<ol><li>(vii.193) Prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in healthy people. </li><li>(vii.68) Protect the heart from inflammation and atherosclerosis promoted by chronic exposure to air pollution. </li><li>vii.194) Regulate or help lower high blood pressure. </li><li>(vii.193, 195) Restores antioxidant levels and reduces free radical damage from toxic chemotherapy drugs. </li><li>(vii.193) Improve age-related stiffening of blood vessels, especially combined with exercise. </li><li>(vii.196) Reduce heart damage caused by chronic kidney disease (by blocking free radical damage and boosting mitochondrial function). </li><li>(vii.197) Help stop the formation of dangerous blood clots, including those that cause strokes.</li><li>(vii.198-199) Prevent cardiac hypertrophy due to high blood pressure, heart attack, high salt intake, or diabetes.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts are the cells mainly involved in fibrosis.</li><li>(vii.13) Suppressing inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-κB) and cytokine proteins (such as TNF-α) that can activate HSCs directly and/or indirectly. For example, TNF-α directly blocks signals from insulin, the hormone needed to metabolize blood sugar. Impaired sugar metabolism can activate HSCs. (vii.13, 31, 279) Promoting other transcription factor proteins, such as PPAR-γ, that block the activation and proliferation of HSCs. PPAR-γ also suppresses the expression of inflammatory proteins, such as the growth factor TGF-β, that promote collagen production. </li><li>(vii.13, 198) Decreasing harmful triglyceride and cholesterol deposits in the liver. </li><li>(vii.279) Reducing type I collagen, the primary substance in fibrotic scar tissue in the liver produced by HSCs and fibroblasts.</li></ol>"

Italians have prized this way of eating as a cornerstone of their “Dolce Vita” lifestyle for centuries, and the proof is in the panna cotta. Experts believe this healthy, active way of living could be why one of the five Blue Zones worldwide, areas where people regularly live to be over 100 years old, can be found in the Mediterranean. Blue zones like the one in Sardinia, Italy offer secrets to longevity unavailable anywhere else, and their secrets are more important now than ever as worldwide cases of heart-related diseases in women and men are at an all-time high. Bruno MD, a part of one of Italy's largest pharmaceutical companies, has worked tirelessly to harness some of the heart-supporting ingredients of these Blue Zones and the Mediterranean diet and bring them to you, no passport required. The result is the revolutionary supplement CholestQ10®",

          "expanded": "Our bodies have evolved to view beneficial plant-based polyphenols as useless or dangerous. For this reason, nutrients that help manage inflammation, like curcumin, are blocked by your gut before they can enter your bloodstream. So no matter how much curcumin you take, the benefits are minimal without the new Phytosome Technology used by Bruno MD. Phytosome uses biomimicry to wrap polyphenols in a fatty lipid, like a delivery truck. Then, with the curcumin molecule hidden inside, the lipid passes through the gut and into your bloodstream with 3000% more bioavailability. As a result, Phytosome sets the new standard in prescription-grade natural ingredients. CHOLESTQ10 PROPRIETARY PHYTOSOME® COMPLEX is a powerful combination of clinically proven ingredients validated in more than 40 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. It is also shown to have long-term high tolerability (the degree to which a person can tolerate noticeable adverse effects of an ingredient) in an 18-month clinical study with no side effects.",

If you've tried Earl Grey tea, you're familiar with the taste of bergamot. Bergamot Phytosome® is clinically proven to protect against cardiovascular issues by supporting healthy cholesterol levels. It also helps govern metabolic conditions that increase the risk of heart disease and TYPE II diabetes. It's the green “gold standard” of heart health. In addition, Bergamot Phytosome optimizes the biological absorption of polyphenols, typically characterized by poor solubility in both water and organic solvents. The beneficial flavonoids in Bergamot help maintain healthy blood lipid levels. A recent NHI study showed that daily supplementation with bergamot over thirty helped lower LDL cholesterol and stimulated healthy HDL cholesterol levels. In addition to helping support healthy blood lipid levels, the flavonoids in bergamot also support vascular endothelium health, which is important for vasoconstriction, arterial responsiveness, and overall circulatory health. In addition, Bergamot Phytosome extract helps promote healthy blood glucose levels, which, when combined with a balanced weight management plan and regular exercise, supports general cardiovascular health.",

The secret is in the proprietary vegan ingredients, many of which are found only on Italian soil. These ingredients, along with Natural Vitamin E and Cleveland Clinic-endorsed Curcumin Phytosome, are combined with Bruno MD's Coenzyme Q10 Phytosome. Itself a powerful antioxidant that supports a healthy inflammatory response in the body.

Think of HDL as the 'good' cholesterol because it helps remove LDL from the arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease.<br/><br/> On the other hand, LDL is often called the 'bad' cholesterol because when there's too much of it, it can build up in the walls of your arteries, forming plaque. This buildup leads to atherosclerosis, which narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow. <br/><br/><b>Why We Need to Control It:</b><br/><br/>Controlling bad cholesterol is essential for maintaining good heart health.

                    "review": "I was on statins briefly but I had some really bad side effects. My cholesterol is not critical, but it keeps going up every year and has gotten into the bad range. I need to go see my doctor in the next couple months, so I am attempting to do some improvements to my higher levels by taking this along with some dietary and lifestyle changes. \n I have been taking high doses of COQ10 and was looking to replenish my supply when I saw this product. It has very good high quality COQ10, but also other ingredients that might help my cholesterol including Bergamot, Turmeric, and Cardoon (which is artichoke thistle). \n I take these in the morning - 2 capsules. I like that they are capsules and not hard tablets. They do not give me a tummy ache at all. They recommend taking one in the morning and one at night, but I don’t like taking a lot of supplements in the evening. I pretty much keep my night time intake of supplements to my blood pressure medication and natural herbal sleep aids. This is working well as far as I can tell. \n Along with starting to take this product I am also eating oatmeal every other morning. I also walk at least 30 minutes a day and sometimes 2 hours. I also have a home spinning bike so I do 30-45 minutes on that. I am also trying to lose a bit of weight by tracking my calories using Tap and Track app. My point is, just taking this alone isn’t going to solve high cholesterol levels. Combining this with other lifestyle changes will...at least hopefully in my case. I am working really hard to make those changes. \n My only critique of this product is the bergamot, turmeric, and cardoon are not organic. There is a risk if pesticides were used during the growth in process that those pesticides could be concentrated in the extract. I am marking down by 1-star because of that. \n You also get a little freebie gift with this product and I love it! Is a little hot/cold pack. I love heating it up in the microwave, then putting it between my shoulder blades on my back while I lay on my back. It is so relaxing and helps with stress and tension so much. I never thought something so small could make such a difference. It was a nice surprise to get that with this product.",

                    "review": "I was looking for a bergamot supplement and learned that it can be very pricey depending on quality, etc. \n I considered this formula bc it provided reasonably priced bergamot plus coQ10 which I was already taking. \n I have high cholesterol due to genetics so I figured I would give this a try bc I never want to go on statins. Thankfully I'm the MD says I'm too young to start worrying about even needing statins but in my book, prevention is better than correction. Plus, I like to try/rotate diff antioxidants. Bergamot is high in flavonoids which are supposedto help w/ immune sys & inflammation.\n According to the prior reading I'd done, there isnt enough evidence to conclude that it definitely makes a diff in inflammation but there is a number of studies w/ evidence to prove that it's been effective for the treatment of high cholesterol. \n I don't know if its helped any without getting a blood test and I wont be doing that for another 6 months at least. \n So what I can say is that the manufacturer has really done their best to check all the boxes to provide a robust profile of complimentary supplements. The amber glass bottle is beneficial as well bc both bergamot and coQ10 should not be stored in direct light. The literature enclosed was very detailed and the bottle was securely packaged in a padded box (shown in pix). \n Expiration date on my bottle is June 2022.\n I think its worth giving this brand and this specific formula a try. It does cost less than bergamot only supplements so if you ever wanted to try bergamot but were put off by the price, this would be a great way to ease into it & see how you feel. \n I hope my humble opinion helps you in some way. \n Thank you for reading.",

My only caveat is $2-per-day cost of using this supplement as directed. Nevertheless, Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) has important health benefits, much more so than most supplements. This product uses a variation called CholestQ10, and I'm not clear on how it compares with standard CoQ10. It's also a little confusing as to how much the maker recommends daily. The bottle contains 60 capsules and states \"30 servings,\" but the site recommends 3 capsules per day, which means 20-day supply. \n In any case, the generally recommended maximum daily dose of CoQ10 is 1,200 mg/day, and that's for someone with fairly high bad cholesterol levels, though it might be different for CholestQ10. Consequently, since my cholesterol level is only slightly on the high side, I'm taking one capsule per day in addition to red rice yeast capsules. However, too much CoQ10 is not necessarily dangerous; the most common side effects are minor GI distress. In addition to CholestQ10, the other ingredients seem to provide support for digestion and metabolic processes (but this is based solely on my non-expert research). Tea drinkers will recognize another ingredient (bergamot) as the herbal flavor in Earl Gray.\n In general, the company seems to be a good one that strives to provide quality supplements. However, the price is a little above my monthly budget. Nonetheless, if it proves effective, I'd rather pay for this than for prescription pharmaceuticals. For those with high cholesterol and a more generous budget, I'd recommend giving this a try for at least a few months.",

Bur all the Bruno products I've tried have been very high quality,and this appears the same high level. \n Not to be dismissed = Cardoon -100mg (AKA artichoke thistle) also present - has high levels of Folic acid and is historically used for lowing cholesterol. \n Impressive presentation - comes in a strong cardboard box with a booklet about this product. And a complimentary (reusable) aromatherapy pack that can be heated in the microwave or cooled in the freezer for hot / cold compress. \n Completely vegan - a very high quality product in content and in the vegan capsule. 5 stars",

Italians have prized this way of eating as a cornerstone of their “Dolce Vita” lifestyle for centuries, and the proof is in the panna cotta. Experts believe this healthy, active way of living could be why one of the five Blue Zones worldwide, areas where people regularly live to be over 100 years old, can be found in the Mediterranean. Blue zones like the one in Sardinia, Italy offer secrets to longevity unavailable anywhere else, and their secrets are more important now than ever as worldwide cases of heart-related diseases in women and men are at an all-time high. Bruno MD, a part of one of Italy's largest pharmaceutical companies, has worked tirelessly to harness some of the heart-supporting ingredients of these Blue Zones and the Mediterranean diet and bring them to you, no passport required.

          "expanded": "Our bodies have evolved to view beneficial plant-based polyphenols as useless or dangerous. For this reason, nutrients that help manage inflammation, like curcumin, are blocked by your gut before they can enter your bloodstream. So no matter how much curcumin you take, the benefits are minimal without the new Phytosome Technology used by Bruno MD. Phytosome uses biomimicry to wrap polyphenols in a fatty lipid, like a delivery truck. Then, with the curcumin molecule hidden inside, the lipid passes through the gut and into your bloodstream with 3000% more bioavailability. As a result, Phytosome sets the new standard in prescription-grade natural ingredients. CHOLESTQ10 PROPRIETARY PHYTOSOME® COMPLEX is a powerful combination of clinically proven ingredients validated in more than 40 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. It is also shown to have long-term high tolerability (the degree to which a person can tolerate noticeable adverse effects of an ingredient) in an 18-month clinical study with no side effects.",

If you've tried Earl Grey tea, you're familiar with the taste of bergamot. Bergamot Phytosome® is clinically proven to protect against cardiovascular issues by supporting healthy cholesterol levels. It also helps govern metabolic conditions that increase the risk of heart disease and TYPE II diabetes. It's the green “gold standard” of heart health. In addition, Bergamot Phytosome optimizes the biological absorption of polyphenols, typically characterized by poor solubility in both water and organic solvents. The beneficial flavonoids in Bergamot help maintain healthy blood lipid levels. A recent NHI study showed that daily supplementation with bergamot over thirty helped lower LDL cholesterol and stimulated healthy HDL cholesterol levels. In addition to helping support healthy blood lipid levels, the flavonoids in bergamot also support vascular endothelium health, which is important for vasoconstriction, arterial responsiveness, and overall circulatory health. In addition, Bergamot Phytosome extract helps promote healthy blood glucose levels, which, when combined with a balanced weight management plan and regular exercise, supports general cardiovascular health.",

Think of HDL as the 'good' cholesterol because it helps remove LDL from the arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease.<br/><br/> On the other hand, LDL is often called the 'bad' cholesterol because when there's too much of it, it can build up in the walls of your arteries, forming plaque. This buildup leads to atherosclerosis, which narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow. <br/><br/><b>Why We Need to Control It:</b><br/><br/>Controlling bad cholesterol is essential for maintaining good heart health.

                    "review": "I was on statins briefly but I had some really bad side effects. My cholesterol is not critical, but it keeps going up every year and has gotten into the bad range. I need to go see my doctor in the next couple months, so I am attempting to do some improvements to my higher levels by taking this along with some dietary and lifestyle changes. \n I have been taking high doses of COQ10 and was looking to replenish my supply when I saw this product. It has very good high quality COQ10, but also other ingredients that might help my cholesterol including Bergamot, Turmeric, and Cardoon (which is artichoke thistle). \n I take these in the morning - 2 capsules. I like that they are capsules and not hard tablets. They do not give me a tummy ache at all. They recommend taking one in the morning and one at night, but I don’t like taking a lot of supplements in the evening. I pretty much keep my night time intake of supplements to my blood pressure medication and natural herbal sleep aids. This is working well as far as I can tell. \n Along with starting to take this product I am also eating oatmeal every other morning. I also walk at least 30 minutes a day and sometimes 2 hours. I also have a home spinning bike so I do 30-45 minutes on that. I am also trying to lose a bit of weight by tracking my calories using Tap and Track app. My point is, just taking this alone isn’t going to solve high cholesterol levels. Combining this with other lifestyle changes will...at least hopefully in my case. I am working really hard to make those changes. \n My only critique of this product is the bergamot, turmeric, and cardoon are not organic. There is a risk if pesticides were used during the growth in process that those pesticides could be concentrated in the extract. I am marking down by 1-star because of that. \n You also get a little freebie gift with this product and I love it! Is a little hot/cold pack. I love heating it up in the microwave, then putting it between my shoulder blades on my back while I lay on my back. It is so relaxing and helps with stress and tension so much. I never thought something so small could make such a difference. It was a nice surprise to get that with this product.",

                    "review": "I was looking for a bergamot supplement and learned that it can be very pricey depending on quality, etc. \n I considered this formula bc it provided reasonably priced bergamot plus coQ10 which I was already taking. \n I have high cholesterol due to genetics so I figured I would give this a try bc I never want to go on statins. Thankfully I'm the MD says I'm too young to start worrying about even needing statins but in my book, prevention is better than correction. Plus, I like to try/rotate diff antioxidants. Bergamot is high in flavonoids which are supposedto help w/ immune sys & inflammation.\n According to the prior reading I'd done, there isnt enough evidence to conclude that it definitely makes a diff in inflammation but there is a number of studies w/ evidence to prove that it's been effective for the treatment of high cholesterol. \n I don't know if its helped any without getting a blood test and I wont be doing that for another 6 months at least. \n So what I can say is that the manufacturer has really done their best to check all the boxes to provide a robust profile of complimentary supplements. The amber glass bottle is beneficial as well bc both bergamot and coQ10 should not be stored in direct light. The literature enclosed was very detailed and the bottle was securely packaged in a padded box (shown in pix). \n Expiration date on my bottle is June 2022.\n I think its worth giving this brand and this specific formula a try. It does cost less than bergamot only supplements so if you ever wanted to try bergamot but were put off by the price, this would be a great way to ease into it & see how you feel. \n I hope my humble opinion helps you in some way. \n Thank you for reading.",

My only caveat is $2-per-day cost of using this supplement as directed. Nevertheless, Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) has important health benefits, much more so than most supplements. This product uses a variation called CholestQ10, and I'm not clear on how it compares with standard CoQ10. It's also a little confusing as to how much the maker recommends daily. The bottle contains 60 capsules and states \"30 servings,\" but the site recommends 3 capsules per day, which means 20-day supply. \n In any case, the generally recommended maximum daily dose of CoQ10 is 1,200 mg/day, and that's for someone with fairly high bad cholesterol levels, though it might be different for CholestQ10. Consequently, since my cholesterol level is only slightly on the high side, I'm taking one capsule per day in addition to red rice yeast capsules. However, too much CoQ10 is not necessarily dangerous; the most common side effects are minor GI distress. In addition to CholestQ10, the other ingredients seem to provide support for digestion and metabolic processes (but this is based solely on my non-expert research). Tea drinkers will recognize another ingredient (bergamot) as the herbal flavor in Earl Gray.\n In general, the company seems to be a good one that strives to provide quality supplements. However, the price is a little above my monthly budget. Nonetheless, if it proves effective, I'd rather pay for this than for prescription pharmaceuticals. For those with high cholesterol and a more generous budget, I'd recommend giving this a try for at least a few months.",

They are known for regulating Cholesterol level and heart health. I am surprised it doesn't come with Bioprene to enhance the absorption of Curcumin just like other Curcumin supplements do. Bergamot orange extract is another known ingredient to reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol levels, and increase positive mood. Cardoon Leaf Extract is something new to me. Here it claims to inhibit fat accumulation in the hepatocytes (liver cells).\n Overall, this is a unique recipe from Bruno MD store. I really would to know the exact portions of CoQ10 and Curcumin. You can give it a try. I have not had it long enough to tell anything special. The instruction says one capsule in the morning and another in the evening. \n The packaging is quite excessive. It comes in a foam padded cardboard box. It also has an aromatherapy pouch in the box. It smells lavender.",

This buildup leads to atherosclerosis, which narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow. <br/><br/><b>Why We Need to Control It:</b><br/><br/>Controlling bad cholesterol is essential for maintaining good heart health.

These potent anti-inflammatory properties provide front eye protection by alleviating oxidative stress and help reduce eye fatigue and strain, common symptoms of computer vision syndrome.",

                    "review": "This supplement has bilberry, the one ingredient here that is not included in my regular eye supplement, Areds2. I've read that bilberry has been used by the Navajo Nation for eye care for centuries, and that it works. That's why I decided to try this formula when it was offered through Amazon Vine. \n Having said that, this supplement includes only a one month supply, and costs twice as much as the two-month supply I normally buy from a name brand pharmaceutical company whose product is tested and clinically proven for its stated purpose (which this one is not).\n The other thing that bothers me about this product, besides the price (which throws in an eye massage mask and a glitzy marketing brochure in an expensive gift box), is that the item lists its ingredients as being 229 mg overall, but its label does NOT list the exact amounts of each active ingredient. So one is denied the knowledge of how much of each active ingredient one is taking, whether it is too much vitamin E (or not enough), too much lutein (or not enough), and so on. \n Unfortunately, that makes this item a no go for my future use. There are levels of certain ingredients that are required for eye care. And there are levels of certain ingredients that can be toxic.\n This \"proprietary blend\" does not list what you need to know. \n Thus the company feels free to jack up the price, and it can prevent others from trying to \"knock off\"  its \"special\" formula. Maybe it also hoodwinks some into taking too much or too little of something they need. \n I'll use the formula until it's gone, but I would not buy this again for the stated reasons. My eyes are too previous to play with the unknown. \n Meanwhile I will try to find another standalone source of bilberry to add to my eye regimen and will also try to discover the optimal dosage for bilberry in eye care.",

I opened the capsule and you can see it in the video. The content surprised me with its appearance, color and smell:\n- inside a jelly-like mass in color resembling blood from a vein or clotted blood. Let's think it's blueberry jam. The contents were very viscous, sticky and would stick strongly to any surface. It wasn't tasty. It was not washed off either from the fingers or from the plate or from the knife just by a stream of water. In order to wash it off, I had to take a dish sponge. I washed it off the dishes, but my finger and nail were stained with this content and it didn't wash off immediately. In the photo you can see how my fingers look after I washed them with a dishwashing sponge;\n- the contents of the capsule smell to me like the smell of fish oil. It was like the smell of the opened Fish oil capsule, but not so strong. My wife said that she can smell fish;\n I hope that what I saw and showed you is useful for us and is a combination of useful products.\n Buying any supplements, vitamins and so on, the most important thing is not to harm yourself and not buy any charlatan's product. Therefore, I always try to find out who makes the product. I liked what I learned about this company and the fact that the company has been in business for over 25 years.\n I am an Uber driver and I spend a lot of time behind the wheel, including in the dark. And of course I am no exception, and like most people I like to sit in front of a computer with a phone or tablet. Of course, all this puts a huge strain on the eyes. Therefore, I believe that it is very important to help your eyes, and for this you can do eye exercises and take the appropriate vitamins. Therefore, in my diet there are always blueberries as well as vitamin supplements.\n What I got with this product and what conclusion can I draw:\n - judging by the way the company cares about its image and presents its product, and as I said above, given the company's experience, I tend to trust their product;\n - I liked the bonus in the form of an eye mask. It's not an expensive feature, but nevertheless it's nice to get and useful to use.\n I have to be honest with you: after completing the course and drinking all the vitamins, I did not begin to see further better, and so on. You perfectly understand that miracles do not happen. But I am sure that I supported my eyes and gave them what we lack in our intense rhythm of life. I am sure that I should take care of my eyes and the whole body now so that later in a more mature age I would have fewer problems. \n wish you all take care of your eyes and stay healthy! \n Thanks for reading this review. If my comments were helpful, let me know. You can ask a question and someone from the community will definitely answer you and maybe it will be me.",

And work better together than they do singularly. Bruno says their blend is protection and relief from CVS (Computer Vision Syndrome). which is a main reason I wanted to try this product. This is the fanciest / high end presentation of a vitamin I've ever seen. Comes in a strong cardboard box with 32 page booklet of thier products.

      "popupText":"<b>What is “bad” cholesterol? </b><br/><br/>There are two main types of cholesterol: HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) and LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein). Think of HDL as the 'good' cholesterol because it helps remove LDL from the arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease.<br/><br/> On the other hand, LDL is often called the 'bad' cholesterol because when there's too much of it, it can build up in the walls of your arteries, forming plaque. This buildup leads to atherosclerosis, which narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow. <br/><br/><b>Why We Need to Control It:</b><br/><br/>Controlling bad cholesterol is essential for maintaining good heart health. When LDL levels are high, it increases the risk of developing heart disease and stroke.

I've read that bilberry has been used by the Navajo Nation for eye care for centuries, and that it works. That's why I decided to try this formula when it was offered through Amazon Vine. \n Having said that, this supplement includes only a one month supply, and costs twice as much as the two-month supply I normally buy from a name brand pharmaceutical company whose product is tested and clinically proven for its stated purpose (which this one is not).\n The other thing that bothers me about this product, besides the price (which throws in an eye massage mask and a glitzy marketing brochure in an expensive gift box), is that the item lists its ingredients as being 229 mg overall, but its label does NOT list the exact amounts of each active ingredient. So one is denied the knowledge of how much of each active ingredient one is taking, whether it is too much vitamin E (or not enough), too much lutein (or not enough), and so on. \n Unfortunately, that makes this item a no go for my future use. There are levels of certain ingredients that are required for eye care. And there are levels of certain ingredients that can be toxic.\n This \"proprietary blend\" does not list what you need to know. \n Thus the company feels free to jack up the price, and it can prevent others from trying to \"knock off\"  its \"special\" formula. Maybe it also hoodwinks some into taking too much or too little of something they need. \n I'll use the formula until it's gone, but I would not buy this again for the stated reasons. My eyes are too previous to play with the unknown. \n Meanwhile I will try to find another standalone source of bilberry to add to my eye regimen and will also try to discover the optimal dosage for bilberry in eye care.",

I opened the capsule and you can see it in the video. The content surprised me with its appearance, color and smell:\n- inside a jelly-like mass in color resembling blood from a vein or clotted blood. Let's think it's blueberry jam. The contents were very viscous, sticky and would stick strongly to any surface. It wasn't tasty. It was not washed off either from the fingers or from the plate or from the knife just by a stream of water. In order to wash it off, I had to take a dish sponge. I washed it off the dishes, but my finger and nail were stained with this content and it didn't wash off immediately. In the photo you can see how my fingers look after I washed them with a dishwashing sponge;\n- the contents of the capsule smell to me like the smell of fish oil. It was like the smell of the opened Fish oil capsule, but not so strong. My wife said that she can smell fish;\n I hope that what I saw and showed you is useful for us and is a combination of useful products.\n Buying any supplements, vitamins and so on, the most important thing is not to harm yourself and not buy any charlatan's product. Therefore, I always try to find out who makes the product. I liked what I learned about this company and the fact that the company has been in business for over 25 years.\n I am an Uber driver and I spend a lot of time behind the wheel, including in the dark. And of course I am no exception, and like most people I like to sit in front of a computer with a phone or tablet. Of course, all this puts a huge strain on the eyes. Therefore, I believe that it is very important to help your eyes, and for this you can do eye exercises and take the appropriate vitamins. Therefore, in my diet there are always blueberries as well as vitamin supplements.\n What I got with this product and what conclusion can I draw:\n - judging by the way the company cares about its image and presents its product, and as I said above, given the company's experience, I tend to trust their product;\n - I liked the bonus in the form of an eye mask. It's not an expensive feature, but nevertheless it's nice to get and useful to use.\n I have to be honest with you: after completing the course and drinking all the vitamins, I did not begin to see further better, and so on. You perfectly understand that miracles do not happen. But I am sure that I supported my eyes and gave them what we lack in our intense rhythm of life. I am sure that I should take care of my eyes and the whole body now so that later in a more mature age I would have fewer problems. \n wish you all take care of your eyes and stay healthy! \n Thanks for reading this review. If my comments were helpful, let me know. You can ask a question and someone from the community will definitely answer you and maybe it will be me.",

So it impossible to know if the ingredients one is seeking is here in a goodly amount.

And work better together than they do singularly. Bruno says their blend is protection and relief from CVS (Computer Vision Syndrome). which is a main reason I wanted to try this product. This is the fanciest / high end presentation of a vitamin I've ever seen. Comes in a strong cardboard box with 32 page booklet of thier products. And a complimentary (reusable eye mask that can be heated in the microwave or cooled in the freezer for hot / cold compresses for your eyes.
